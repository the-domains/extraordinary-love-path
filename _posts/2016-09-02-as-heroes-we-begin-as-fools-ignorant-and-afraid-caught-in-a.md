As heroes we begin as fools ignorant and afraid, caught in a mire which prevents us from seeing ourselves clearly.

We must know ourselves truly to have compassion and Love of ourselves. We must love ourselves before we can fully love another.

So only the bold and courageous fools ever find deeper love.

And it is no small task of short duration that allows the hero to clear the mire and follow the call of the Beloved within. It is a massive undertaking; a lifetime of work. It will be perilous and uncomfortable to clear the mire and face that which has blocked the call of Beloved within you.

This Journey is only for the ones who dare to Call in the Light into the darkness to bring peace, compassion and strength beyond limits and die a million ego-deaths to attain the crown jewel of love's mystery. Only these bold ones will know Extraordinary Love.
